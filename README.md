# Telegram Clone Project Overview

This project is a clone of the popular messaging app Telegram, developed using a modern web technology stack that includes Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, and Firebase. It aims to replicate the core features of Telegram, such as instant messaging, using Vue 3's Composition API for reactive programming and Firebase for real-time data handling and authentication. The project leverages TypeScript for type safety and better development experience, and Vite for efficient bundling and hot module replacement.

## Key Technologies and Libraries

- **Vue 3**: Utilized for building the user interface, taking advantage of its Composition API for reactive programming patterns.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static type checking to enhance code quality and developer productivity.
- **Vite**: Serves as the build tool, offering fast rebuilds and optimized production builds.
- **Firebase**: Used for backend services, including real-time database, authentication, and hosting.
- **Vue Router**: Manages navigation within the application, enabling a single-page application (SPA) experience.
- **Vuex**: Facilitates state management across the application, ensuring a consistent and predictable state.
- **Vuetify**: Provides a material design component library for Vue.js, used to speed up the development of the UI.
- **Vue3-Emoji-Picker**: Integrated for emoji selection in messages, enhancing the messaging experience.
- **Sass**: Used for writing more maintainable CSS with the help of variables, nested rules, and mixins.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
